# Python
* Python programs ðŸ¦Ž
* Programs ranging from simple for loops to inference, resolver etc

## Important Questions/Concepts

### Data Structures
* Stack, Queue, Heap, Tree, Arrays, Linked List

### Backtracking
* Choose, explore, unchoose
* Combination sum I & II, subsets I & II, N-queen, knight's problem

### Searching - BFS, DFS
* Stack - DFS - go deep in the tree
* Queue - BFS - shortest path
* Search for nearest zero in matrix - using a Point class

### Recursion + DFS // Backtracking + DFS // How to recursively backtrack?
* Identify if there is DFS needed or not? - want to search something? Eg: a word in a grid -> want to search the full thing?
* BFS - quick search, shortest path
