# tuples

# data structure where we can store data
# coordinates, example

coordinates = (4,5) # ( ) used for tuples, they are immutable, can't be changed
print(coordinates[0]) # prints 4
print(coordinates[1]) # prints 5

# difference between tuples and list ??? - common question

# there can be list of tuples, but can't be modified
